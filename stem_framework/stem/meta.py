'''According to this principle, during the processing of data, only data (immutable initial data in any textual or binary format) and metadata (user-defined tree of values) are allowed to be used as input, meaning no user instructions (scripts) or manually managed intermediate states are possible. This means that user is forced to use declarative approach to describe what should be done instead of imperative one.'''
