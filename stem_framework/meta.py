# metadata (user-defined tree of values) are allowed to be used as input, 
#meaning no user instructions (scripts) or manually managed intermediate states 
#are possible. This means that user is forced to use declarative approach to describe
#what should be done instead of imperative one. One can automatically transform 
#metadata, use it to cache analysis results or even send instructions to remote 
#computing node. All these features are hard to implement using scripting approach.
